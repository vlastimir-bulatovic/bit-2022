// Inheritance is used whenever we have the same functionalities, so to not duplicate code we use inheritance

// if two object have the same listener we can abstract that code and inherit in ou object

// if we have shared behavior we can abstract it and use it across multiple objects

// any code that is duplicate can be abstracted

// in JS inheritance is done via prototypes (you can google prototype design pater if you want more info)
// There are multiple ways to create inheritance
// Classes are syntax sugar
